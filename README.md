## TinyTTA Engine

TinyTTA Engine is a lightweight framework for enabling Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) on edge devices like microcontrollers (MCUs). Built upon TFLM, it features:

- On-device backpropagation with floating-point computation
- Support for common DNN operators (ReLU, FullyConnected, Softmax, Maxpool, Avgpool, Conv, DepthwiseConv)
- Memory-efficient layer-wise update strategy with dynamic allocation
- Automatic differentiation for backward graph construction
- Graph optimization through operation fusion and quantization

The framework is specifically designed to operate within the resource constraints of edge devices while enabling model adaptation capabilities.

**Note**: Fully public release of the code is coming soon! Stay tuned for updates.
